## `api.experimental.getLockedUtxos(): Promise<TransactionUnspentOutput[]>`

Errors: `APIError`

Returns an array of all currently locked UTxOs.

A locked UTxO is either pending in an already submitted transaction or was locked manually by a wallet user to prevent
the spending of the UTxO, eg. if a user wants to keep an ADA Handle on a certain address.

We might want to split that in the future into getLockedUtxos() and getPendingUtxos().

The reason for function: dApps need to be aware of UTxOs, that are currently present on-chain, but were already spent, to
be able to update their UI and transaction building accordingly.
